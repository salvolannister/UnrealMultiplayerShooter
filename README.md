# unreal-shooter-game-ex-one
Exercise to show ability in coding based in adding features to the base template from unreal " ....".
Features (networked) added by now:
- Jetpack:
You can hold "J" to use the jetpack until the fuel showed by the green bar is expired
- Teleport:
You can press "T" to teleport yourself 10 m haed
- Drop Weapon:
When the player dies it will drop the weapon that could be collected by other players. The gun dropped
is the same the player was using with its current loaded and not loaded clips.
- Shrink Weapon:
When a player is hit by a rocket of the shrink weapon. They shrinks and if someone stomp on they, they dies.

#TODO

- Aggiungere overlay dello shrinking
- Provare a settare bIsActive to false prima di prendere l'arma
- [IMPROVEMENT] Save mymovement component in a variable inside My_ShooterCharacter so 
that I won't need to cast it every time I ask for it
https://youtu.be/Of8SGBa3WvU?t=340
- [IMPROVEMENT] Implement client prediction for dropped gun
- [BUG] Se Ã¨ il server ad essere colpito, il tempo nel component in carico dello shrinking non viene aggiornato correttamente
e quindi la barra nella HUD non scorre
- [BUG] Il pick up lato client avviene con un po' di lag

#OF NOTICE
Sto usando they al posto di he/she al singolare
